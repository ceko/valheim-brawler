**MOD Description** 

Valheim Brawler is a mod that makes use of the underdeveloped unarmed skill. It adds 6 new tiers of weapons:  

* Wood sprig
* Studded knuckles
* Bronze cestus
* Iron cestus
* Silver cestus
* Black metal cestus  

and one supporting recipe:  

* Iron chain

The long-term goal of the mod is to provide additional armors, consumables, and even animations to support a more visceral brawler-like playthrough.

**Installation**

2) Download it and follow the installation manual
3) Drag the unzipped Valheim Brawler folder into -> <Steam Location>\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx\plugin  

The next time you start your game, the mod will be enabled. To disable it, just remove it from the mods folder.

**Usage**

Recipes should appear in game through normal play. If you are installing this mod on an existing playthrough, you will have to pick up items or re-order you inventory to learn the new recipes.

---
**Caveats and Warnings**

1) This is an Alpha mod, and you are helping to playtest it. 

2) If the mod is disabled and the game is loaded all modded items will be lost. This is a limitation of the save/load pipeline included in the game. If this happens you can easily re-enable the mod and use the spawn command to regain your items.

Prefab names:

* WoodKnuckles
* StuddedKnuckles
* BronzeCestus
* IronCestus

* BlackMetalCestus
